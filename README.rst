==================================
pywrangler - python data wrangling
==================================

**pywrangler** is a collection of *data wranglers* designed for
the pydata ecosystem. Its main purpose to provide well tested and documented
solutions for commonly used tasks such as:

- extracting intervals (given start and end values) from time series
- mapping timestamps to time spans
- deduplicating overlapping time spans
- exploding/unpacking arrays

The reference implementation is built on top of pandas. Additionally,
distributed computation frameworks like pyspark and dask are supported.
